Polymate combines the power of [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) and [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org) Databases with the simplicity of the [Morphia](http://code.google.com/p/morphia)-Framework and a self-written API that maps annotated POJOs to both, MongoDB and Neo4j.
By doing that, the strengths of both databases can be used.
The flexible data-model of MongoDB with it's easy sharding and good query support as well as the graph data model of Neo4j, which is great in persisting and querying relations.

Please feel free to take a look at the source-code. If you have any questions or ideas please contact me.
